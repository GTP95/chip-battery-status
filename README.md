# CHIP battery status for headless server

A simple script to display battery percentage 
on the xfce4 desktop of NextThing.co's CHIP

Works nicely with PocketCHIP.

## How to install
Download/clone the files to your CHIP.
```
cd chip-battery-status
sudo ./install.sh
```

Now you need to add a panel item to your xfce4 desktop.

1. Right-click (_or Ctrl-click_) on an existing panel item,
e.g your clock. Choose `Panel > Add New Items...`

(_or Ctrl-click_) it and choose `Properties`

for the `Period (s)` enter `5`. Hit `Close`

## How to uninstall
```
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
This will disable the battery status polling service
and remove previously-installed scripts and files.

It will not remove the desktop panel item. To remove that 
simply right-click (_or Ctrl-click_) the item and select 
`Remove`.

## Customisation
You can change the way the battery status is
displayed by editing `/usr/local/bin/chip-battery-xfce-genmon`.

Follow the instructions on the [xfce4-genmon-plugin](http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin)
page to change colours, add images, etc.
